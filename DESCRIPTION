Description: Concordance probability estimate (CPE) is a commonly used performance measure in survival analysis that evaluates the predictive accuracy of a survival model.  It measures how well a model can distinguish between pairs of individuals with different survival times.  Specifically, it calculate the proportion of all pairs of individuals whose predicted survival times are correctly ordered.
